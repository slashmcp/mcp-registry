feat: Add debug endpoint and verify HTTP headers forwarding

- Added /v0.1/debug/server/:serverId endpoint to inspect server metadata
- Useful for troubleshooting API key configuration issues
- Verifies that httpHeaders are stored correctly in metadata

This helps diagnose 403 PERMISSION_DENIED errors by checking:
- Whether metadata.httpHeaders exists
- Which headers are configured
- If API keys are present (masked for security)

The endpoint is useful for verifying Google Maps API key setup
before attempting tool invocations.
